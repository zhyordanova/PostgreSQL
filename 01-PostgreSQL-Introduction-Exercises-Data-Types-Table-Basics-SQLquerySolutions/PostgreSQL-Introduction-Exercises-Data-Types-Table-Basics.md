### 0. Create a Database
Use a SQL query to create a new database named `minions_db`.

### 1. Create a Table
In the newly created database, write a SQL statement to create a table named `minions` with the following columns:
- `id` - primary key, auto-incremented.
- `name` - max length of 30 characters.
- `age` - whole number.

Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

### 2. Rename the Table
Rename the table `minions` to `minions_info`.  
Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

---

### 3. Alter the Table
Add new columns to the `minions_info` table:
- `code` - exactly 4 characters long.
- `task` - text with no length limit.
- `salary` - numeric with 8 digits and up to 3 decimal places.

Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

### 4. Rename Column
Rename the column `salary` to `banana`.  
Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

---

### 5. Add New Columns
Add the following columns to the `minions_info` table:
- `email` - max length of 20 characters.
- `equipped` - boolean (TRUE, FALSE, or NULL). Add a constraint to disallow NULL values.

Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

### 6. Create ENUM Type
Create an ENUM type named `type_mood` with the values:
- `'happy'`
- `'relaxed'`
- `'stressed'`
- `'sad'`

Add a column `mood` of type `type_mood` to the table.

### 8. Add Constraints
Add constraints to the following columns:
- `id` and `email` - should be UNIQUE (constraint name: `unique_constraint`).
- `banana` - should be greater than `0` (constraint name: `banana_check`).

Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

### 9. Change Columnâ€™s Data Type
Change the data type of the column `task` to limit its length to 150 characters.  
Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.
